## Objective

This script monitors processor, memory and disk useage and displays them in a web interface. 

It aims to mimic the "Performance" tab of Windows Task Manager in a simplistic way, with the history going back one hour instead of one minute. 

## Limitations

This project has only been tested on Debian. Other flavors might need some tweaking.
